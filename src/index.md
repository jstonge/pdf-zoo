# Getting-Started

Welcome to the [Computational Ethics Lab](https://www.compethicslab.org/) space for interactive visualizations. The Computational Ethics Lab is a research group located in the Vermont Complex Systems Center at the University of Vermont. Our team brings together a post-disciplinary group of researchers, faculty, staff, and students working in complex systems, computational social science, data science, computer science, and philosophy. This research group works to gain a deeper understanding of the ethical impacts of emerging technology on socio-technological systems. We also work on many other research areas that we, importantly, find fun and exciting.
